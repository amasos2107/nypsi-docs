## how do i bake more cookies?

there are 2 ways to get cookies.
grandmas bakes 0.5 cookies each hour
to increase the AFK time of your grandmas you can use ovens, they add +1 hour of afk time. If you have 12 ovens and you dont bake for 11 hours your grandmas still bake and stack up the cookies.

cursor / supercursor increase your cookie production
cursor add +1 cookie each bake
supercursor +1 min &  max cookie when baking, so the value is a random number between it. 

there are also 2 ways to double the output of cookies are the guild upgrade "double cookies" 0.5% for every upgrade. another way are gems like crystal heart (5%), white (2%), pink (0,5%) and blue (0,1%)

## how do i bake cakes?
there is only 1 way to get cakes.
If you use grandpas there is a chance of 0.5% to bake a cake. The percent chance doesnt stack up if you have more grandpas its only 0.5% each grandpa so the chance of getting more cakes varies according to the number of the grandpas.


## how do you get upgrades?

the upgrades like Grandmas, grandpas, cursor, supercursor and ovens can you get them from different crates and scratchcards like basic_crate, 69420_crate, Nypsi_crate, dailyscratchcards, luckyscratchcards.
